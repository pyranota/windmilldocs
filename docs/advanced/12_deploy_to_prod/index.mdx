# Deploy to prod

To deploy to prod, 3 options are possible.

[Draft and deploy](#option-1-draft-and-deploy---single-workspace) is the simplest method. It is meant to be used in a single workspace.

[Git integration](#option-2-deploy-to-prod-using-a-git-workflow---multi-workspace-recommended) is clearly the superior, most powerful method but it is more complex. Usually, to deploy to prod you would want absolutely to have the normal CI flow that goes through one review which is something that is built-in with GitHub/GitLab. Also you may want to put some CI checks there.

However, in a setting where you have dev/staging/prod, you could use the [UI to deploy to staging from dev](#option-3-deploy-to-prod-using-the-ui-only---multi-workspace), and then use git between staging and prod to tighten down prod.

## Option 1. Draft and deploy - Single workspace

A simple setup in which deploying to prod means deploying items that have been iterated on in the UI as Drafts.
Deployments in Windmill are commonly done from the same workspace using the [Draft and deploy](../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) buttons.

## Option 2. Deploy to prod using a git workflow - Multi workspace (recommended)

The integration can be used to push from git, and receive changes done from the UI in a bi-directional way.
You can also use a separate dev and staging branch and repo and have Windmill create automatically branches and Pull Request upon any changes deployed to staging/dev.

This process can be used in particular for [local development](../4_local_development/index.mdx) with a solid setup:

## Option 3. Deploy to prod using the UI only - Multi workspace

From a workspace in Windmill, you can deploy a script/flow/resource/variable and all its dependencies to another workspace.

Deploy to prod using the UI is [Cloud plans and Self-Hosted Enterprise Edition](/pricing) only.
