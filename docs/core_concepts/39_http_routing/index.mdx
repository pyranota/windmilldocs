# Custom HTTP routes

Windmill supports custom HTTP routes to trigger a script or flow. 
They can only be created by [admins workspace](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#admins-workspace). 
All properties of the route apart from the http path can be modified by any user with write access to the route.

## How to use

Create a new route on the HTTP routes page.
Specify the path of the http route. You can use the `:param` syntax to define parameters.
Parameters can be handled using a [preprocessor](../43_preprocessors/index.mdx).
You also need to select the method of the route (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE).

The full http route takes the following form:
- Self-hosted Windmill: `{base_url}/api/r/{path}`
- Windmill cloud: `https://app.windmill.dev/api/r/{workspace_id}/{path}`

Select the runnable that should be triggered by this route. To quickly get started, you can use the `create from template` button to generate a runnable template.

Here's an example script:

```TypeScript
export async function main(/* args from the request body */) {
    // your code here
}
```

And if you use a [preprocessor](../43_preprocessors/index.mdx), the script could look like this:

```TypeScript
export async function preprocessor(
  /* args from the request body, let's assume `name` and `age` */
  name: string,
  age: number,
  wm_trigger: {
    kind: "http",
    http: {
      route: string; // The route path, e.g. "/users/:id"
      path: string; // The actual path called, e.g. "/users/123"
      method: string;
      params: Record<string, string>; // The route parameters, e.g. { id: "123" }
      query: Record<string, string>; // The query parameters
      headers: Record<string, string>;
    }
  },
) {

  // define args for the main function
  // let's assume the id is passed in the path (e.g. "/users/:id") and we want to pass it with the body (name, age) to the main function
  return {
    user_id: wm_trigger.http.params.id,
    name,
    age,
  };
}

export async function main(user_id: string, name: string, age: number) {
  // handle arguments, e.g. update the name and age of the user with the given id
}
```

The route also supports additional configuration options:
- **Request type**: Whether the route should return the id (async) or the result (sync) of the runnable.
- **Authentication**: Whether the route should require authentication. If authentication is required, the user needs to have read access to both the route and the runnable.
