# Microsoft Teams integration

[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) is a collaboration platform that integrates with Office 365.

There are two ways to build interactions between Microsoft Teams and Windmill: run code on Windmill by a Microsoft Teams command or use the
Microsoft Teams API directly from Windmill. In this guide, we'll cover both approaches.

## Action on Windmill from MicrosoftTeams

The goal here is to be able to invoke a Windmill Script from Microsoft Teams, by using
`/windmill` command.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/teams_handler.mp4"
/>

<br />

First, you need to be a **workspace admin**. Then you
should go to

<a href="https://app.windmill.dev/workspace_settings" rel="nofollow">
	Workspace Settings Page
</a>
and select the "Slack / Teams" tab. On there, click "Connect to Microsoft Teams".

:::info Self-hosted

The Microsoft Teams integration is done through OAuth. On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).

:::

Note that you can connect multiple Windmill workspaces to the same Teams bot. Only one Windmill workspace can accept the `/windmill` [commands](#using-commands-on-teams) from a given Teams "Team".

### Using commands on Teams

Once you connected your workspace to a Teams Team, you can either select an existing script or flow to handle the `/windmill` command, or create a new one by clicking the "Create a script to handle teams command" button.

You will be navigated to the Script editor. Give your script a name
(e.g. `teams_command_handler`), a short summary (e.g. "Teams command handler"). You'll get to [this](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/teams/11409/example-of-responding-to-a-microsoft-teams-command-teams) template:

```typescript
import * as wmill from "windmill-client"

export async function main(
  activity_id: string,
  command: string,
  from_name: string,
  team_id: string,
  teams_message: any
) {
  // Your business logic
  const res = "task completed successfully!"

  // (optional) Send update to Teams channel about completion of job
  await wmill.TeamsService.sendMessageToConversation(
    {
      requestBody: {
        conversation_id: activity_id,
        success: true,
        text: `Hi, ${from_name}, command: ${command} ran successfully with the following result: ${res}`
      }
    }
  )
}
```

After the Script is deployed, navigate back to the

<a href="https://app.windmill.dev/workspace_settings?tab=slack" rel="nofollow">
	Teams settings
</a>
Choose the "Script" option for adding a command handler and select your newly created Script.

![Connected settings](../assets/integrations/teams-connected.png.webp)

Congratulations! You've just created a Teams command handler. Now you can use
the `/windmill` command in your Teams workspace to trigger the Script. 

In addition to activity_id, the script/flow can use the following parameters, simply by having them as inputs with the proper name:

```
# the ID of the activity in the Teams conversation
activity_id 

# the command that was triggered
command 

# the name of the user who triggered the command
from_name 

# Microsoft Teams Team ID
team_id 

# the original payload from the Teams backend
teams_message 
```

![Use the Windmill command](../assets/integrations/teams-command.png.webp)

You won't be able to have Teams interact with your [resources](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) and [variables](../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) before adding them to the `teams` [group](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#groups) that was automatically created by Windmill after you set up your Teams workspace on Windmill.

<details>
  <summary>How to let Teams use your resources and variables:</summary>

To give the permission, go to "Resources" (and "Variables") menu, click on `Share`, `Group` and pick `teams`.

<br />

![Share to teams group](../assets/integrations/teams-teams_group.png.webp)

<br />

One simplier way to handle permissions is to host resources and variables on a [folder](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders) that is part of the [group](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#groups) `teams`.

### Handle multiple commands

You can extend your workspace script to handle complex commands coming from Teams messages. [This article](/blog/handler-slack-commands) shows how to manage multiple commands & human-in-the-loop steps for a slackbot using [branches](../flows/13_flow_branches.md), a text parser and [approval steps](../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx) and can be easily adapted to Teams.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Tutotial - Handler of multiple Slack commands"
		description="Create a flow with a parser & branches that will handle multiple Slack commands."
		href="/blog/handler-slack-commands#control-the-slackbot-by-getting-username"
	/>
</div>

### Monitor who ran the command

You can see who ran the `/windmill` command by going to the

<a href="https://app.windmill.dev/runs" rel="nofollow">
	Runs page
</a>
on Windmill. The runs will be permissioned through the `g/teams` global group.

![Run info](../assets/integrations/teams-permissions.png.webp)

One of the parameters passed to the script is the "from_name" parameter, which is the name of the user who triggered the command. To process further teams specific details from the command, you can use the "teams_message" parameter.

```

### Error handlers

Microsoft Teams is an efficient way to be notified of errors on a Windmill run, whole workspace or instance. Windmill provides an integration for error / success / recovery handling on Microsoft Teams.
